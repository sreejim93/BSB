This code provides a good structure for implementing and running Hidden Markov Models (HMM) using the Viterbi, Forward, Backward, and Baum-Welch algorithms, 
but there are parts that still need to be completed, specifically in the Forward, Backward, and Baum-Welch functions.

Key Functions:
viterbi(X, A, E):

This function implements the Viterbi algorithm for a single sequence X, using transition probabilities A and emission probabilities E. 
It computes the most probable state path and the corresponding probability.

forward(X, A, E):

This function computes the forward probability for a sequence X by implementing the forward algorithm. 
It's similar to Viterbi but sums over possible states instead of taking the maximum.

The code needs to fill in the logic for the middle and last columns in the forward trellis, ensuring that forward probabilities accumulate correctly.

backward(X, A, E):

The backward algorithm computes the backward probability, following a similar structure as forward, but in reverse order. 
This function needs completion to correctly process the sequence in reverse, updating the backward trellis.

baumwelch(set_X, A, E):

This function is for training the HMM using the Baum-Welch algorithm. 
It maximizes the likelihood of a set of sequences given the initial transition and emission probabilities.

The function currently includes placeholders for transition and emission matrix updates but needs to implement the expectation and maximization steps in full. 
Specifically, the transitions and emissions need to be normalized correctly, and sums for the matrix updates should be calculated based on the forward and backward results.
