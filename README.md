The hidden_markov.py script implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sequence prediction,
training the model using the Viterbi algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation. 
It predicts state sequences and calculates emission and transition probabilities.


The 'align.py' script performs sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms,
implementing global and local alignment with dynamic programming. It reads sequence data, computes alignment scores, 
and outputs aligned sequences with statistical analysis.
